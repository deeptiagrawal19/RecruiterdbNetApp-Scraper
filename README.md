# RecruiterdbNetApp-Scraper
Automate the extraction of recruiter emails from RecruiterDB using Selenium and AppleScript on macOS. This script interacts with the website, clicks on email buttons, copies email addresses via the Mail app, and stores them in an Excel file.

## **⚠️ Disclaimer: Designed Exclusively for RecruiterDB**
🔴 **This script is specifically developed to extract recruiter emails from [RecruiterDB](https://recruiterdb.web.app/).**
