# RecruiterdbNetApp-Scraper
Automate the extraction of recruiter emails from RecruiterDB using Selenium and AppleScript on macOS. This script interacts with the website, clicks on email buttons, copies email addresses via the Mail app, and stores them in an Excel file.

## **Disclaimer: Designed Exclusively for RecruiterDB** **This script is specifically developed to extract recruiter emails from [RecruiterDB](https://recruiterdb.web.app/).**  
**The logic is tailored to the structure and behavior of this website, including button interactions, email retrieval, and pagination handling.**  

💡 While the core automation principles remain the same, the script may require modifications to adapt to other websites due to variations in UI elements and authentication mechanisms.
